# Final-Project


Setup Instructions:
Open the project code file in any Python IDE, click run, and the game will commence! No external libraries are needed to support.


Project Overview:
Our project is a Python based text fighting game, reminiscent of games we grew up with. There are three playable characters--knight, dragon, and wizard--and the game creates a computer enemy that moves randomly and also can play as any of those characters. Moves each have a unique chance of hitting, adding a bit of spice to the gameplay. The game additionally has natural elements which have random chances of occurring and hitting one player or both.
