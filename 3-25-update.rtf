\f0\fs24 \cf0 This week, we have made the game functional. There is a computer and a main player, the person running the python script, as well as different moves they can use. For now, we have 1 character to use\'97however, this week, now with the core features of the project implemented, we plan to add a few other characters and moves to deepen the fun of the game.\

We are still a bit unsure of what our GUI will look like, especially because we\'92re presenting pretty much first, which gives us a heavy time crunch. We will check in with each other and Dr. Fatema this week. }
